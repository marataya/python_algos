# prompt: Write a set of Python classes that can simulate an Internet application in which one party, Alice, is periodically creating a set of packets that she wants to send to Bob. An Internet process is continually checking if Alice has any packets to send, and if so, it delivers them to Bobâ€™s computer, and Bob is periodically checking if his computer has a packet from Alice, and, if so, he reads and deletes it
