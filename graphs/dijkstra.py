    Dijkstra's Single Source Shortest Path Algorithm

    Uses ability to increase priority of existing element.
    In a BinaryHeap, all values are inserted initially, then
    thereafter, only removals and reprioritizations occur.

Change Log:
-----------
2015.07.31    Original implementation used G.nodes() to get nodes. Since
              we restrict to specific range, changed to range(len(G)).
              This was done primarily to allow us to use this class
              unchanged in the next module (6. Graph Representation)
